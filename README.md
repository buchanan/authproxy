# SSO Authentication Proxy

This project was created to solve a problem with monitoring applications that require Single Sign-On (SSO). It functions as a proxy that offloads authentication, ensuring that requests passing through are automatically authenticated.

## Features
- Acts as a proxy to handle authentication for applications requiring SSO.
- Allows seamless authentication for monitoring tools.
- Generalized for public releaseâ€”references marked with `"changeme"` should be updated accordingly.

## Disclaimer
This project was written some time ago, and functionality may vary based on your environment. However, it may serve as a helpful reference for building a similar solution.

## Usage
- Update all instances of `"changeme"` with appropriate values for your setup.
- Deploy the proxy in an environment where it can intercept and authenticate requests.
